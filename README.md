# Turing @ DMF

This repository contains **Turing @ DMF**, the customized version of [**Turing**](https://gitlab.com/drago-96/turing) used at the [Department of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.dmf.unicatt.it/), [Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://www.unicatt.it/).

[**Turing**](https://gitlab.com/drago-96/turing) is an open-source software for the management of a team competition within the [Italian Mathematical Olympiads](http://olimpiadi.dm.unibo.it/le-gare/gara-a-squadre/), and is developed by Riccardo Zanotto, Matteo Migliorini, Federico Poloni, Matteo Protopapa, Matteo Rossi.

**Turing @ DMF** customizes the upstream version of **Turing** for the specific needs of the [Department of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.dmf.unicatt.it/), [Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://www.unicatt.it/), as follows:
1. [Containerization using Docker](docker/README.md)
2. [Interaction with **mathrace** in-house implementation](mathrace_interaction/README.md)
3. [Local patches for compatibility with **mathrace** in-house implementation](patches/turing/README.md)

**Turing @ DMF** is currently developed and maintained at [Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://www.unicatt.it/) by [Prof. Francesco Ballarin](https://www.francescoballarin.it).

Like **Turing**, **Turing @ DMF** is freely available under the AGPL-3.0-or-later license.
