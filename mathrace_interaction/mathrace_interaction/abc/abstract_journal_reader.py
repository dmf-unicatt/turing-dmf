class AbstractJournalReader(abc.ABC):

    An abstract class representing a reader of a mathrace journal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    journal_stream
        The I/O stream that reads the journal generated by mathrace or simdis.
        The I/O stream is typically generated by open().

    Attributes
    ----------
    _journal_stream
        The I/O stream that reads the journal generated by mathrace or simdis, provided as input.
    _last_event_datetime
        Time of the last processed event to ensure that events are correctly sorted.
